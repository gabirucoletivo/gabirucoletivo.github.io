                    We are a Latin American collective of artists and researchers based in Lisbon. Formed in 2023 by Thaynã Targa (Brazilian), Fabio Curi (Luso-Brazilian), and Pablo Díaz (Italo-Chilean), we explore aesthetic and theoretical issues of contemporaneity related
                    to the field of technology.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We dive into and enjoy experimenting with emerging tools, while also seeking to understand the political and social impacts these structures produce. Through digital experimentation and hybrid media, we explore narratives ranging between tradition and
                    innovation, crafts and code, space and interface, politics and poetics.

                            Musician, Sound Artist, Craftsman. He began his music studies at the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, later in Sound Art at the Universitat de Barcelona. He recently successfully completed the thesis process for his master's degree in Art and
                            Science of Glass and Ceramics at VICARTE, FCT, Nova University of Lisbon (UNL). His research is fundamentally related to clay, ceramics and glass in relation to the sound that these materials can produce. His practice is fundamentally
                            framed in the area of sound sculpture. In parallel, another relevant part of his practice has to do with the incorporation of digital media, especially open source, in his research and artistic production strategies, as a way
                            of trying to connect tradition, craft, science and technology. Sound sculpture, sound design and ASMR elaboration are strategies that together with audiovisual processes, shape the body of work he has developed to date.
