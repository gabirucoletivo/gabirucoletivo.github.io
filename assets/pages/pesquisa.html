        <p>
            Collective Gabirú develops its research from a practice that unites listening, drift and experimentation. Its work is anchored in the between — in what escapes rigid structures, in what reveals itself through cracks and silences. Instead of seeking definitive
            answers, the collective operates through sensitive approximations, creating relationships with the territory, its visible and invisible layers, its sounds, materials, stories and own rhythms.
        </p>
        <p>
            The group's investigation starts from a restless curiosity, which attentively observes what normally goes unnoticed. They work with the idea of displacement — physical, conceptual, sensory — and with the juxtaposition between human and machine, artisanal
            and digital. Technology, in this context, is not an end, but a means: a critical tool to create images, sounds, objects and experiences that reflect the ways of living and imagining.
        </p>

        <p>
            Authorship, in Gabirú's process, dissolves into a collective gesture, where each member contributes with subjectivities that interweave and transform over time. The archaeology of everyday life, urban noises, discarded materials, small forgotten narratives:
            everything can be raw material. The collective acts as a mediator of meanings, creating spaces for the unexpected to emerge and for art to exist as a possibility of presence, listening and invention.
