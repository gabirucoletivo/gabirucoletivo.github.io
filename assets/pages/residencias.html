            <p>How many details can we find in yesterday's debris? And how can they connect to the construction of something that does not belong to the present, but rather to the future?

                Throughout three months (between September and November 2023) of technological and multimedia arts residency at the Artistic Hub of Rego, Collective Gabirú immersed itself in an almost archaeological creative experience in the territory, collecting traces
                of a time already past and mixing it with tools available in the present, such as algorithms or software, to imagine possible futures.

                An artistic residency in Bairro do Rego is a deep immersion in a territory rich in historical, cultural and social layers. During the period of coexistence, artists approach local daily life through listening, attentive observation and interaction with
                residents. The neighborhood, marked by contrasts between traditional and modern, offers visual, sound and symbolic stimuli that inspire unique and contextual creative processes.
            </p>

            <p>
                The residency proposes a living exchange between art and community, allowing artists to experiment with different languages and supports based on the specificities of the place. Walks, conversations, records and material collections become a fundamental
                part of the work developed. More than producing artistic objects, the proposal is to generate connections, raise reflections and activate memories of the territory.
            </p>

            <p>
                Digital technologies, artisanal techniques and experimental practices interweave to create works that dialogue with time, landscape and local affections. The residency transforms Rego into a field of poetic investigation, where past, present and future
                intersect in cracks of meaning. In the end, what is revealed is less a conclusion and more an invitation to continue the curious and sensitive gaze over the neighborhood.
